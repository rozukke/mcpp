\href{https://cplusplus.com/}{\texttt{ }} \href{https://github.com/rozukke}{\texttt{ }} \href{https://github.com/rozukke/mcpp/blob/main/LICENSE}{\texttt{ }}\textbackslash{} {\bfseries{mcpp}} (Minecraft++) is a library built to interface with Minecraft through \href{https://www.spigotmc.org/}{\texttt{ Spigot server}} running the \href{https://github.com/rozukke/ELCI}{\texttt{ ELCI}} plugin and using C++. It is currently limited to Mac\+OS/\+Linux or Windows with WSL.

âž¡ For more details on the broad strokes of {\bfseries{mcpp}}, refer to the \href{https://github.com/rozukke/mcpp/wiki/Index}{\texttt{ wiki}}!\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{History}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
This library is based on \href{https://github.com/martinohanlon/mcpi}{\texttt{ mcpi}}, which is a Python library with similar functionality.

In addition to C++ support, this library implements several new commands supported by \href{https://github.com/rozukke/ELCI}{\texttt{ ELCI}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily get\+Blocks} to get a cuboid of blocks with modifiers in a performant manner,
\item {\ttfamily get\+Heights} to get a 2D area of heights in a performant manner,
\item {\ttfamily do\+Command} to perform an in-\/game minecraft command which allows for additional functionality.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This C++ version was created for the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) to supplement the COSC2084 (Programming Studio 2) course.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{Windows}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Since the release is intended for UNIX systems and not tested on Windows, the options to run locally are as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Build manually (there are included CMake build files)
\item Run with WSL, in which case follow the Linux instructions below. You may need to specify a connection address manually in {\ttfamily Minecraft\+Connection()} if you are running Spigot with ELCI on Windows, which you can find using {\ttfamily nslookup \char`\"{}\$(hostname).\+local\char`\"{}} on your WSL terminal. The default port for ELCI is {\ttfamily 4711}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{Mac and Linux}\label{index_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install {\ttfamily g++}, {\ttfamily make}, {\ttfamily cmake} and any other build prerequisites
\item Clone this repository via {\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/rozukke/mcpp.git}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/rozukke/mcpp.\+git}}}
\item Install by running {\ttfamily cmake .} and {\ttfamily sudo make install} inside the cloned directory.
\item After doing this, the library should be accessible via a {\ttfamily \#include $<$\mbox{\hyperlink{mcpp_8h}{mcpp/mcpp.\+h}}$>$} directive.
\item When compiling code using the library, use the flag {\ttfamily -\/lmcpp} for Makefiles or {\ttfamily target\+\_\+link\+\_\+libraries(your\+\_\+executable mcpp)} for CMake.
